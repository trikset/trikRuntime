/// Widget that shows current IP address and a list of available WiFi networks.
/// Network is available when it is listed in /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf or it is open network without security.
///
/// Protocol of communication between this widget and underlying WiFi controller is highly asynchronous due to
/// use of wpa_supplicant, which uses asynchronous message passing to communicate with client software.
/// 1. Upon construction widget requests status from WiFi controller.
/// 2. Upon construction widget requests scan from WiFi controller (so every time this widget is opened it will
///    ask WiFi controller to rescan networks, no "Rescan" button is needed).
/// 3. On status response it shows IP address and connection status.
/// 4. On Scan response it refreshes list of available networks (and shows them instead of "Scanning..." message). It
///    also clears internal network info model and repopulates it with new information.
/// 5. On selecting new network in a network list widget moves to "connecting" state and then tries to connect.
/// 6. After "connect" request widget expects "disconnected" signal and then "connected" signal.
///    6.1. Planned "disconnected" signal is ignored since widget is already in "connecting" state.
///    6.2. "connected" signal moves widget to "connected" state and causes to refresh ip address and connection status
///         indication.
///    6.3. If widget does not receive "connected" signal in time, it will move to "errored" state (with proper
///         indication).
/// 7. If a widget gets unplanned "disconnect" signal from WiFi controller, it will move to "notConnected" state and
///    initiate network scan.
/// 8. Receiving "scanFinished" signal will cause widget to refresh available networks list.
/// 9. It is possible to receive unplanned "connected" signal, widget will update connection information accordingly.
