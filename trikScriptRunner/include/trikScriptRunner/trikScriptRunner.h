	/// @warning: The multithreaded script must not contain useful actions in the global context
	/// (function calls, variable initializations and so on in the global context is restricted).
	/// The reason is in non-thread-safety of script engine. We must run scripts by separate script engines
	/// and thus to have an opportunity to start concrete function from the given file. But QScriptEngine API
	/// has no such possibility so we should append function call to the end of the script. So if script will
